# Dumb Language Identification System (ML/Python)

## 📝 Project Overview
Developed a real-time sign language recognition system using machine learning and computer vision. The system translates hand gestures into text or speech, assisting individuals with hearing and speech impairments in effective communication.

## 🔹 Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Uses OpenCV and TensorFlow to detect and classify hand gestures.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trained a neural network using TensorFlow for accurate sign language identification.
- **Dataset Handling**: Collected and preprocessed a dataset of sign language gestures for training and validation.
- **Live Prediction**: Captures video input and provides real-time predictions, displaying recognized words on screen.
- **Text-to-Speech Integration**: Converts recognized signs into spoken words for seamless communication.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed an intuitive interface to display recognized gestures clearly.

## 📌 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas
- **Concepts**: Deep Learning, Image Processing, Computer Vision
